I am a Ph.D. student and Graduate Research Assistant in the [School of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://engineering.purdue.edu/ECE) at [Purdue University](https://www.purdue.edu/). I conduct my research in the  under the guidance of Professor Saurabh Bagchi. I work in [Dependable Computing Systems Lab (DCSL)](https://engineering.purdue.edu/dcsl/) and I am advised by [Professor Saurabh Bagchi](https://www.saurabhbagchi.us/). I hold a Master's degree in Computer Science from the [Lahore University of Management Sciences (LUMS)](https://lums.edu.pk/), where I worked in the [Distributed Computing Lab](https://web.lums.edu.pk/~ncbc/affiliated-labs/distributed-computing-lab/) with [Professor Zafar Ayyub Qazi](https://web.lums.edu.pk/~zafar/).

My research aims to make the Internet more efficient and reliable. Currently, I am working on enhancing the efficiency of Large Language Models (LLMs) by increasing their throughput through advanced scheduling techniques. Additionally, I am exploring cost-effective solutions for serverless applications by enabling cloud providers to run these applications on diverse infrastructure. Previously, my work focused on identifying root causes of failures in microservice architectures, and during my Masterâ€™s, I worked with a team to develope a low latency and consistent cellular control for 5G technologies.

You can find a list of my publications [here](/publications).
